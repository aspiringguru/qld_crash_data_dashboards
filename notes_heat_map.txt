various methods
- K-Means aims to partition the observations into a predefined number of clusters (k) in which each point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.
- Self Organizing Maps (SOMs)
- Affinity Propagation is a graph-based algorithm that assigns each observation to its nearest exemplar.
